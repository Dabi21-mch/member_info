# member_info
Short introduction of WTM Bambili
To contribute to this project, you need to fork this repository.
Next you have to add your membership details to the wtm_members.json file. A template is provided as the first input in the array. Copy and paste it underneath the last item of the array. Finally, edit what you pasted as follows:
* For the "id" value, replace null with the id value of the last item of the list plus 1 (this will be considered as your member id)
* For the "name" value, replace "null" with your name.
* For the "language" value, replace "null" with your favourite programming language.
Make sure you put a comma after the curly braces before pasting(no comma after the language). Once you are done, commit your changes and create a pull request:)
